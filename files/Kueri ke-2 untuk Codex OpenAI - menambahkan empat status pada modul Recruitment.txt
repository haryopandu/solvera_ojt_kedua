Kueri ke-2 pembuatan modul OJT (On the Job) Solvera menggunakan Codex dari OpenAI:

Now, regarding Recruitment module (hr_recruitment) from Odoo 18 itself, please make four new stages: Pending, Shortlisted, Accepted, and Rejected. Also, please add a new button called "Enroll to OJT" in the Recruitment but it is only active if the candidate is on the "Accepted" stage.

Lastly, please use the substitute for "attrs" attribute because "attrs" is deprecated in Odoo 18
